### WHY WE ARE IGNORING EROWIDS COPYRIGHT NOTICE

> At PsychonautWiki, we believe that information transcends law. We believe that information transcends any human boundary. Everyone has a right to access information.

The information contained in their voluntarily submitted reports can help us protect people by instrumenting data that can be extracted from these reports.

Not only will the information help understanding usage patterns. Through careful correlation of health and usage parameters contextual relationships between substance use and how effects manifest can be derived.

We fundamentally oppose permission-based research. Research shall always be open, transparent and communicated. Research shall never be ceased due to political or strategical goals or opinions.

We will publish any research results openly.
